The pitted and mineralized Maquoketa-Dubuque contact resembles many other corrosion surfaces in the Upper Mississippi Valley Galena Group (Witzke, 1985b), and likely formed in a submarine, not subaerial environment. If the suggestion of Brown (1974) that upwelling of oxygen-poor, phosphate-rich waters into a typical carbonate shelf edge produced the diminutive Maquoketa faunas is correct, then this community, with a significant but small echinoderm component, marks the transition from the highly affected Palaeoneilo fecunda-Nuculites neglectus Community (with almost no echinoderms) to the more normal marine Thaerodonta recedens-Iowacystis sagittaria Community. Benthic assemblages have not been defined for many Ordovician communities as yet, but a position analogous to BA 3-4 is probable (see also Witzke & Glenister, 1987, for further discussion)."	"The lithology is a poorly consolidated to pyrite-cemented dolomitic phosphorite ranging in thickness from 0.1 to 0.3 m. Most common are small (<2 mm) subsphaeroidal concentrically laminated hydroxylapatite clasts, but less well rounded phosphate clasts up to 15 cm in length and phosphatized fossils are also abundant. Locally quartz geodes ranging in size from 1 cm to more than 25 cm in length are common, e.g., at the type locality. The geodes contain minor sulfide mineralization (wire marcasite) and common calcite, ferroan dolomite, fluorite, and selenite crystals in the often largely hollow interiors... This community appears to have been subject to some current activity, but not frequently enough to remove selectively particular size clasts. The deposit is very poorly sorted, at least basally, with clay to gravel-sized clasts intermixed, some or all of which may be phosphatized."

A relatively high content of bitumen is characteristic of the sediments of the Siuge Member. The limestones consist of cross-bedded channel fillings with thin argillaceous interlayers (Fig. 3). Locally, layers or nodules of chert occur at the bottom of the channel structures. The layers with chert nodules have a thickness of less than five centimetres and contain numerous small but macroscopic remains of predominantly bryozoan zooaria, ostracod tests, and echinoderm ossicles.

To the south it intertongues with the upper members of the Lexington Limestone, but to the north it becomes younger and intertongues with the shales of the Kope Formation in north-central Kentucky.\r\nLimestone makes up 30 to 60 percent of the Clays Ferry Formation.  Beds are even and 1 to 6 in thick.  The limestone varies from medium- to dark-gray, argillaceous calcisiltite to medium-gray brachiopodal limestone to medium-gray crinoidal calcarenite.  The calcisiltite is sparsely fossiliferous and contains mainly crinoidal fragments and some gastropods.  The brachiopoal limestone is characterized by abundant Rafinesquina, some of which are shingled, as well as by Sowerbyella and Dalmanella, all packed in a mud matrix.  Bryozoans are also common.\r\nShale makes up 30 to 60 percent of the formation.  It is generally greenish to olive gray, and is present in distinctly laminated sets 1 to 12 in thick.  Fossils generally are sparse in these shales, though bryozoans are common at some locations.\r\nSiltstone makes up 5 to 10 percent of the unit, occurring mainly in the upper part.  It is present mostly in 1- to 3-in even beds in which fossils are sparse.

In the western sections, the member is 15 m thick and is dominated by interbedded massive to laminated and thin-bedded micrites, calcareous mudstones, and grainstones. Individual micrite beds are typically 3 to 15 cm thick and have a sharp, planar base overlain by a thin layer of broken fossils. This basal lag is overlain by massive to weakly laminated micrite(floatstone), which appears to be partially bioturbated. Chondrites burrows are common, commonly forming 2% to 5% of the rock. The upper surfaces of the micrites, and parts of the overlying calcareous mudstones, are pitted and burrowed. The lateral continuity of individual beds is high (tens of metres) although some thinning and thickening are evident along strike. Larger scale architectural elements, including channels and symmetrical, draped waveforms are apparent in the cliff face and in tidal-flat exposures.\""	"\"shale\""	"burrows"	"lithified"	"argillaceous,silty"	""	"lime mudstone"	"wave ripples,planar lamination,bioturbation"	"lithified"	"argillaceous,calcareous"	""	""	-94.07	-19.36	101	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	""	"2014-07-21 15:56:12"	"2014-11-02 21:33:00"
